# PROBLEM STATEMENT
1. With the growth of e-commerce websites, people and financial companies
rely on online services to carry out their transactions that have led to an
exponential increase in the credit card frauds . Fraudulent credit card
transactions lead to a loss of huge amount of money. The design of an
effective fraud detection system is necessary in order to reduce the losses
incurred by the customers and financial companies .

2. Research has been done on many models and methods to prevent and
detect credit card frauds. Some credit card fraud transaction datasets
contain the problem of imbalance in datasets. A good fraud detection
system should be able to identify the fraud transaction accurately and
should make the detection possible in real-time transactions.[Credit Card REPORT.docx](https://github.com/pragya4710/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detector/files/9252129/Credit.Card.REPORT.docx)
